    <section>

        <li>Shipping coordination — label generation and tracking via Shippo.</li>
        <li>Marketplace upkeep — keeping the website running and improving.</li>

    <section>
      <h2>6) How Hemline Market Works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Listing</strong> — Sellers create listings with accurate descriptions, photos, and prices.</li>
        <li><strong>Buying</strong> — Buyers pay through Hemline Market's checkout. Payment is held until the buyer confirms delivery, or released 5 days after confirmed tracking if no issue is reported.</li>
        <li><strong>Shipping</strong> — Buyers pay shipping. Shipping is charged per seller based on the total yards in your cart:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Lightweight — $5</strong> <br><span class="note">under 3 yards of fabric, and notions</span></li>
            <li><strong>Standard — $8</strong> <br><span class="note">3 to 10 yards of fabric</span></li>
            <li><strong>Heavy — $14</strong> <br><span class="note">more than 10 yards of fabric, and large items</span></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Returns</strong> — All sales are final. In rare cases where an order arrives in a condition different from its listing, buyers may request a return within 3 days of confirmed tracking delivery. If approved, the buyer is refunded and the seller does not receive payment.</li>
        <li><strong>Disputes</strong> — Issues should be reported directly to Hemline Market.</li>
      </ul>
